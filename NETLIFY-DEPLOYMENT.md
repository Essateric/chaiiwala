# Netlify Deployment Guide for Chaiiwala Dashboard

This guide outlines the steps to deploy the Chaiiwala Dashboard to Netlify, ensuring that both the frontend and backend components work correctly.

## Deployment Changes and Improvements

### Content Security Policy (CSP) Settings

The application now includes CSP settings that allow the necessary JavaScript functionality:

1. **HTML Meta Tag**: Added to `client/index.html` to ensure JavaScript `eval()` functions can run properly.
2. **Netlify Headers**: Configured in `netlify.toml` to apply the same security policy for the deployed site.

These changes solve issues with frontend JavaScript functionality that were previously blocked by default security policies.

### Authentication and Session Management

The Netlify serverless function has been enhanced with:

1. **Improved Session Configuration**: Properly configured for cross-origin requests with appropriate cookie settings.
2. **Enhanced CORS Settings**: Better handling of cross-origin requests from multiple domains.
3. **Robust Error Handling**: More detailed error responses and logging for authentication issues.

### Deploying the Application

You can deploy the application using the provided deployment script:

```bash
# Deploy to draft environment (testing)
node netlify-deploy.js

# Deploy to production environment
node netlify-deploy.js --prod
```

The deployment script now ensures that:
- All necessary files are built correctly
- Serverless functions are properly deployed
- Content Security Policy settings are applied

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables should be set in your Netlify dashboard:

1. `SESSION_SECRET` - Secret key for session encryption (already configured in netlify.toml)
2. `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string (if using database storage)
3. `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production" for production deployments

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the deployed application:

1. **Authentication Problems**: Check Netlify function logs for detailed error messages.
2. **JavaScript Errors**: Ensure the CSP settings are correctly applied in both HTML and netlify.toml.
3. **API Connection Issues**: Verify CORS settings if connecting from custom domains.

## Deployment Architecture

The application follows a serverless architecture on Netlify:

1. **Frontend**: React application served as static files
2. **Backend**: Express API running as Netlify serverless functions
3. **Authentication**: Passport.js for local authentication with secure sessions
4. **Storage**: In-memory storage by default, with option for PostgreSQL database

This architecture ensures scalability and reliability while minimizing hosting costs.
